Description: Request to perform a match/fuzzy search across files in a specified directory, providing context-rich results. This tool searches for specific content across multiple files, displaying each match with encapsulating context.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current working directory ${args.cwd}). This directory will be recursively searched.
- query: (required) The keyword/phrase to search for. The system will find documents with similar keywords/phrases.

Usage:
<match_search_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<query>Your keyword/phrase here</query>
</match_search_files>

Example: Requesting to search for all Markdown files containing 'test' in the current directory
<match_search_files>
<path>.</path>
<query>test</query>
</match_search_files>`

	return `## regex_search_files
Description: Request to perform a regex search across files in a specified directory, providing context-rich results. This tool searches for patterns or specific content across multiple files, displaying each match with encapsulating context.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current working directory ${args.cwd}). This directory will be recursively searched.
- regex: (required) The regular expression pattern to search for. Uses ${regex_syntax} regex syntax, **but should not include word boundaries (\b)**.

Usage:
<regex_search_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<regex>Your regex pattern here</regex>
</regex_search_files>

Example: Requesting to search for all Markdown files in the current directory
<regex_search_files>
<path>.</path>
<regex>.*</regex>
</regex_search_files>`
}

export function getSemanticSearchFilesDescription(args: ToolArgs): string {
	return `## semantic_search_files
Description: Request to perform a semantic search across files in a specified directory. This tool searches for documents with content semantically related to your query, leveraging embedding vectors to find conceptually similar information. Ideal for finding relevant documents even when exact keywords are not known or for discovering thematically related content.

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Craft your natural language query to describe concepts and ideas rather than specific patterns
- Use this tool to find thematically related content, conceptually similar notes, or knowledge connections across the Obsidian vault, even when exact keywords aren't present
- The results include context, so analyze the surrounding text to understand the conceptual relevance of each match
- Leverage this tool in combination with other tools for comprehensive analysis (e.g., use semantic search to find relevant content, then use read_file to examine full context before making changes)

Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current working directory ${args.cwd}). This directory will be recursively searched.
- query: (required) The natural language query describing the information you're looking for. The system will find documents with similar semantic meaning.
Usage:
<semantic_search_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<query>Your natural language query here</query>
</semantic_search_files>

Example: Requesting to find documents related to a specific topic
<semantic_search_files>
<path>Project/notes</path>
<query>Benefits of meditation for stress reduction</query>
</semantic_search_files>`
